# PGN_scoresheet_generator
This website generates scoresheets using [PGN files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation). Written in plain HTML5 for markup, CSS3 for styling and JavaScript for logic, so that it can be accessed straight from GitHub pages: https://burraabhishek.github.io/PGN_scoresheet_generator/.

## Features:
- Can render scoresheets in annotated form or as it is.
- Can parse PGN files from some of the best chess websites, including [chess.com](https://www.chess.com) and [lichess.org](https://lichess.org).

## Usage:
- Copy the PGN text from the file to the text box, and select one of the two options to generate the scoresheet.

## Local setup:
Just clone or download the repository, and open `index.html` on your web browser. No special installations are required. All modern web browsers can render this website.

## Privacy
The input PGN is parsed using only JavaScript. No input data is sent to the server at all while the scoresheet is being generated.
